    - Added tlc_fades.h
    - Added include "tlc_config.h" to Tlc5940.h so it's not required
        in the sketch
    - Added Tlc.setAll(value)
    - Changed a few for loops in Tlc5940.cpp: used *p++ instead of having
        p++ in the increment section of the for loop; changed to while loops

    - Tlc.init() sets all channels to zero and updates.
    - Added TLC_PWM_PERIOD and TLC_GSCLK_PERIOD to tlc_config.h

                                               (if TLC_CHANNEL_TYPE is uint16_t)
    - Changed the examples to use TLC_CHANNEL_TYPE
    - set DATA_TRANSFER_MODE default to TLC_SPI

    - Added tlc_animations.h and examples
